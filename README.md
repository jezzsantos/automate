# automate
Harvest patterns from your code, program them, then share them with your team.

## What is it?

Automate is a tool for tech leads (or lead developers) that want to teach their team some coding patterns to use in their software product or solution.

It works like this:

1. You identify a pattern in your codebase.
2. You name the pattern, and you define some variables for the things that can be changed in it (eg. the names of things in the pattern)
3. You create a template from your pattern, and define defaults for the variables.
4. You optionally define when and where the pattern can be re-used in your codebase.
5. You ship it to your team to use.
6. They apply the pattern in their code, and define the variables in the pattern for their needs.
7. The code (folders, files etc) are written for them, and they move on.

## What problem does it solve?

Often, for many teams (that include individuals varying degrees of expertise from novice to expert) a tech lead needs to make some key technical decisions about how things need to get done in that codebase. Consistency is key here, so that the team can move freely across the codebase and have a shared understanding of it. 

This kind of knowledge is earned over the years of doing similar things in other codebases, and is often adapted and improved for the current codebase. No two codebases are the same, but the patterns are always similar. Often improving over time.

The challenge the tech lead has is communicating this knowledge in a form that can be learnt and reused by others, and also adapted for the current codebase.

One of the main challenges in codebases for team is that others in the codebase will reinvent unfamiliar code patterns because they are unaware that the team already possesses this kind of knowledge. 

Another major challenge is not knowing how to solve certain problems in the codebase nor where to put certain solutions in the code. This results in solutions being peppered around the codebase as workarounds are introduced.

A tech lead needs to remain vigilant to ensure that established patterns and architectures are not violated because of lack of knowledge of other team members.

Todays, languages and tools (IDEs) are so general purpose that they cannot be used to help enforce or constrict the programmer from performing these violations and adding unsustainable workarounds.

Tech Leads could use a little help from their dev tools.

## Does this apply to you?

If these assumptions about your software team are **all true**, then you might consider taking a look at **automate**.

1. You work on a codebase with others - you are a software team.
2. You are the tech lead of the team. (the lead dev, or have some other well respected position in the team).
3. You contribute code yourself to this codebase, and you communicate often with others on your team.
4. You have some coding patterns worth sharing in the codebase.
5. Your team values: consistency, clarity, and maintainability.
6. You accept that you can be wrong sometimes, and that your codebase necessarily changes over time.

OK, then if this sounds like your context then maybe we can help you define (and enforce) some coding patterns across your codebase.

## Getting Started

Download and install the installer?
